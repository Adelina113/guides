# all your base are belong to you.

This guide is intended to act as a tour of the Base ecosystem in order to help
with technical ramping to the protocol. It is intended to be a crash course moving
through major topics, providing links to articles and tutorials to help filter out
the significant amount of noise one encounters when trying to learn how blockchain
works for the first time. This is not exhaustive, but many of the resources
referenced within the guide have additional content in their portals to go deeper
once you have a functional understanding. All resources are free to access, and
all time estimates are ScientificWildAssGuesses (SWAG).

The guide is intended to be read in the following order (but feel free to jump around as you see fit):
