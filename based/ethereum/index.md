# Ethereum

<p><img width="61.4" height="100" src="./eth-diamond-purple.png"/></p>

Base is a layer 2 (L2) blockchain network built on top of Ethereum. In order to
understand how the L2 rollup works, you need to have a good understanding of how
Ethereum works.

To start you should read the original [Ethereum whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/). A lot of the
technology behind Ethereum has changed since then (most significantly the move
to full Proof of Stake after the merge), but many of the core pieces of Ethereum
as a computational platform are explained here. (1 hour)

Base Camp (the Base developer guide) has a good [Intro video on Ethereum](https://docs.base.org/base-camp/docs/introduction-to-ethereum/intro-to-ethereum-vid/) (8 min)

The Ethereum Foundation maintains a set of articles around the core functionality of Ethereum. These are all core readings to understand the protocol. Most of these articles are short and should take roughly 5 - 10 min each.
